# Billing / Invoicing System

🎓 Academic project developed for the **Software Engineering** course at **ISPTEC**, focused on the design and implementation of a **billing (invoicing) system** using **Java** and **MySQL**.

The project applies core software engineering principles, object-oriented programming, and database integration to solve a real-world business problem.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This system was designed to simulate a **real-world invoicing process**, allowing the management of clients, products, invoices, and payments.

The main goal was to apply **software engineering concepts** learned during the course, including system modeling, modular design, and database persistence.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and implement a functional billing system  
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles  
- Integrate Java applications with a **MySQL database**  
- Model real business rules related to invoicing  
- Consolidate knowledge acquired in Software Engineering  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Database:** MySQL 8.x  
- **Architecture:** Layered / Modular architecture  
- **Paradigms:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Tools:** JDBC, SQL  

---

## ⚙️ System Features
- Client management (create, update, delete)  
- Product and service management  
- Invoice generation  
- Database persistence using MySQL  
- Structured and modular codebase  

---

## 🧱 System Architecture
The system follows a modular approach, separating responsibilities into logical layers such as:
- Data access  
- Business logic  
- Application control  

This separation improves **maintainability, scalability, and code readability**.
